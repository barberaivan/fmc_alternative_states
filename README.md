microclimate contains code to fit the vpd model.  
fmc_models contains code to fit fuel moisture models, as shown in the article, using VPD as predictor.  
fmc_models_rh_temp has the same models but using relative humidity and temperature as predictors.  
vegetation_structure contains the code to analyse vegetation structure and species composition. Its main results are shown in Supplementary Information 1.  

Some scripts and R objects are named using the common name of the species studied:  
Cania = *Chusquea culeou*,   
Laura = *Schinus patagonicus*,  
Coihue = *Nothofagus dombeyi*.
