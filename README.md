# fmc_alternative_states

Repository for the article *Microclimate and species composition shape the contribution of fuel
moisture to positive fire-vegetation feedbacks*.

microclimate contains code to fite the vpd model.  
fmc_models contains code to fit fuel moisture models.  
vegetation_structure contains the code to analyse vegetation structure and species composition. Its main results are shown in Supplementary Information 1.  

Some scripts and R objects are named using the common name of the species studied:
Cania = *Chusquea culeou*, 
Laura = *Schinus patagonicus*, 
Coihue = *Nothofagus dombeyi*.
